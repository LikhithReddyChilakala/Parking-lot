# Parking Lot System

## Overview
A backend system that simulates a multi-level parking lot with efficient parking spot allocation.

## Problem
Parking systems require structured allocation and tracking of parking spots across multiple levels.

## Solution
An object-oriented design that manages vehicles, parking levels, and spot assignment using clean abstractions.

## Key Features
- Multi-level parking support
- Vehicle-based spot allocation
- Efficient data structures for parking management
- Clean, modular design

## Concepts Used
- Object-oriented design
- Data structures
- Design patterns
